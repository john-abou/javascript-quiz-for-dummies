# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz


## Description
My motivation for making this page was to practice my javascript skills and using the WebAPI. I furthered my understanding of using functions as I incorporated the use of the WebAPI in my functions to update the page as the user took certain actions. Specifically I learned how to add/remove elements and update styling by adding classes or ids usint the WebAPI.

I also will be adding this to my portfolio from assignment 2. I'm looking forward to continue to learn more about 3rd party API's and jQuery so I can make even more powerful webpages with less typing lol.
